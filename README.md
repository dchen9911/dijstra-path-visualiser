# Dijkstra Path Visualiser
Implementation and visualisation of Dijkstra shortest path finding algorithm (with some shortcuts to speed it up) to traverse waypoints in a 3D space that also contains obstacles. Originally built for the UAV Challenge 2020 but adapted since.

Setup can be changed by changing variables in `settings.py` as well as limited command line options
